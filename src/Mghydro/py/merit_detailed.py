"""
Performs a detailed, raster-based watershed delineation with `pysheds`,
but only inside of a *single* unit catchment.
This is my implementation of the *hybrid* method that I "invented" -- but which was actually
first described in a a paper by Djokic and Ye at the 1999 ESRI User Conference.
Raster-based delineation is slow and requires a lot of memory. So we only do the bare minimum,
and use vector data for the rest of the upstream watershed.

    Performs the detailed pixel-scale raster-based delineation for a watershed.

    To efficiently delineate large watersheds, we only use raster-based methods in a small area,
    the size of a single unit catchment that is most downstream. This results in big
    savings in processing time and memory use, making it possible to delineate even large watersheds
    on a laptop computer.

    Args:
        wid: the watershed id, a string
        basin: 2-digit Pfafstetter code for the level 2 basin we're in (tells us what files to open)
        lat: latitude
        lng: longitude
        catchment_poly: a Shapely polygon; we'll use it to clip the flow accumulation raster to get an accurate snap
        bSingleCatchment: is the watershed small, i.e. there is only one unit catchment in it?
            If so, we'll use a lower snap threshold for the outlet.

    Returns:
        poly: a shapely polygon representing the part of the terminal unit catchment that is upstream of the
            outlet point
        lat_snap:  latitude of the outlet, snapped to the river centerline in the accumulation raster
        lng_snap: longitude of the outlet, snapped to the river centerline in the accumulation raster

    For HIGH PRECISION, we will discard the most downstream catchment
    polygon, and replace it with a more detailed delineation.
    For this, we will use a small piece of the flow direction raster
    that fully contains the terminal unit catchment's boundaries,
    and do a raster-based delineation.
    This finds all of the pixels in the unit catchments that contribute flow to our
    pour point. Then, we will convert that collection of pixels to a polygon,
    and merge it with the upstream unit catchment polygons.

    Read the flow direction raster, but use "Windowed Reading",
    where we only read in the portion
    of interest, surrounding our catchment. See:
    https://mattbartos.com/pysheds/file-io.html
    There is no need to read the whole file into memory, because we are only
    interested in delineating a watershed within our little most-downstream unit catchment.
    Upstream of that, we used vector-based data
    For the window, get the bounding box for our catchment
    a tuple with 4 floats: (Left, Bottom, Right, Top)
    Note pysheds lets you read in a rectangular portion (and not a portion based
    on polygon geometry. We will clip the accumulation raster with the unit catchment
    polygon in a separate step below. (Not a clip per se, but we will replace the values
    in cells that are outside the unit catchment with NaN. This way, these cells will be
    ignored during the "snap pour point" routine, and we will only find rivers that are
    inside our unit catchment. It took me a while to figure out this workflow, but it is
    the key to getting accurate results!
